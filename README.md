# CF S3 Demo

This is a simple example of using Amazon S3 for asset storage. It is an image catalog to which you can upload images and see them on the main page.

## Running Locally

* Create a file called `application.yml` in `src/main/resources`. It should have the following structure (replace the values with those appropriate for your environment):

<pre><code>---
s3:
  aws_access_key: <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
  aws_secret_key: <YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY>
  bucket: the-bucket-name-you-want-to-use
mongo:
  host: mongo-host
  port: 12345
  dbname: mongo-db
  username: mongo-user
  password: mongo-pw</code></pre>

* Run `./gradlew assemble`
* Run `java -jar build/libs/cf-s3-demo.jar`
* Browse to http://localhost:8080

## Running on Cloud Foundry

Assuming you already have an account at http://run.pivotal.io:

* Using `cf create-service`, create a MongoLab service.
* Using `cf create-service`, create a User-Provided service, making sure its name begins with "s3". It should have the following credentials (assign values appropriate for your environment):
    * `awsAccessKey`
    * `awsSecretKey`
    * `bucket`
* Run `./gradlew assemble`
* Run `cf push --path build/libs/cf-s3-demo.jar`. When asked if you'd like to bind existing services, bind the two services you created.
